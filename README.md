# Waterflow-Testbench
For use directly by copy pasting into Arduino IDE. Developed as a short term, fast solution to provide a waterflow testbench.

# Usage
To toggle pins, flash your Arduino (program was developed on an Arduino Nano - If you are using a different board, you may want to check and configure your pins).
Open the serial monitor in the "tools" section. From here, type any number or combination of numbers up to 1-5, for example "4", "12345", "14" to toggle the desired pins.
